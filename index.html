                <h2>What is Parent Hero?</h2>
                <p>Parent hero is a text based puzzle adventure where the player guides the character to different rooms in the game. In each room the player can interact with certain items and people. 
                    The games takes much of its inspiration from retro text based adventures, such as Shadowgate, Déjà Vu and Zork. 
                </p>
                <p>The idea started after I took part in a hackathon with a retro gaming theme.
                    My team made a smaller version of a game similar to this, but with less interactivite and less content to explore. I liked the project a lot and wanted to expand on the idea and make a short
                    puzzle adventure using the same style.
                </p>
                <p>Big shoutout to Andrew, John, Helena, Katherine and Yorick for the awesome and fun experience of creating our game.</p>

                <p>The game screen may be daunting at first, but it is not as complicated as it looks. Just follow these steps and you will be fine. 
                    Below you will find a detailed explanation of what you will see on the screen, as well as a step by step on how to play</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>The screen</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Image screen: Will give you a representation of your current surroundings. <em>note</em> the image may not be exact. 
                                Not all you see is interactable, and things of import may not show on the screen, always refer to the narrator for what to interact with</li>
                            <li>Narrator text box: This box will display the information given to you by the game's narrator</li>
                            <li>Inventory box: Shows you what item you are currently holding</li>

                        <h3>Playing the game</h3>
                        <p>In order to play the game, you must give the game commands. This is done using the two action inputs. Write what actoin you want to use in the action input (4) and then a target in the target input (5)
                            The actions you can take are (use only lower case letters for actions):
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>move - this action lets you move to a different location of your choice. Write the name of your desired location in the target input (5)</li>
                            <li>search - using this while leaving the target input blank will allow you to search your current location. Writing the item you are currently holding in the target input will allow you to search that item</li>
                            <li>pick up - allows you to pick up an item if it is present in the room</li>
                            <li>give - allows you to give what you write in the target window (provided you are holdiing it of course) to the character present at your location</li>
                            <li>talk to - allows you to talk to the target, if the target can hear you and is able to respond</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

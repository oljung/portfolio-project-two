                <h2>What is Parent Hero?</h2>
                <p>Parent hero is a text based puzzle adventure where the player guides the character to different rooms in the game. In each room the player can interact with certain items and people. 
                    The games takes much of its inspiration from retro text based adventures, such as Shadowgate, Déjà Vu and Zork. 
                </p>
                <p>The idea started after I took part in a hackathon with a retro gaming theme.
                    My team made a smaller version of a game similar to this, but with less interactivite and less content to explore. I liked the project a lot and wanted to expand on the idea and make a short
                    puzzle adventure using the same style.
                </p>
                <p>Big shoutout to Andrew, John, Helena, Katherine and Yorick for the awesome and fun experience of creating our game.</p>
